# CRAN comments for: ivgets

## Second Resubmission, 6 July 2022

* The title should contain "2SLS" and not "2sls" because this is a standard abbreviation in the econometrics and statistics literature. "2SLS" stands for "Two-Stage Least Squares". See also, for example, https://www.stata.com/manuals/rivregress.pdf

* There is no published reference about the methods that are implemented in this package since this is part of my ongoing PhD research. I agreed with the CRAN maintainer that I will add a reference to the DESCRIPTION once such a reference is available.
